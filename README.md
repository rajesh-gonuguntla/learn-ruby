Install Ruby Version Manager on my Ubuntu 12.04 LTS
===================================================
Ref:  https://rvm.io/rvm/install#explained

Ruby Version Manager allows you to easily install, manage, and work 
with multiple ruby environments from interpreters to sets of gems.


There are 3 ways to install RVM:

1. Single user
2. Multi User
3. Mixed

I've used multi user installation using the following command:

sudo curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

It has installed latest stable rvm release "rvm 1.22.3" on my ubuntu 12.04 LTS

Setting ruby version to be used as default.

rvm use --default 1.9.3
